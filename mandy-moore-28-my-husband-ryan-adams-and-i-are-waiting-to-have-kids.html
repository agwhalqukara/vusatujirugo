Moore's also trying to learn her way around the kitchen before having to whip up baby food: "I don't cook very well at all," she admits. "I'm the girl that can't make scrambled eggs."</p><p>Another reason Moore is putting off motherhood for the time being: She's hard at work on a new album! Chatting with <a href=#>CBSNews.com</a> in July, Moore revealed that she'll enlist Adams to help out with her seventh studio effort.</p><p>"There's tremendous influence right now around the house," she told the site, adding that the pair have been writing together. "From the music I've been introduced to, and being very happy and in a healthy, relationship. I think that still garners a lot of material to write about."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vJloZrCvp2PCtLnAoJizoZ6ae6S7zGianqSVl7%2BqwNhmpKilo2S7psPSaKSappSueq67zqucZmpoYrq6eceuqpuZnpl6s8XAp2SanJGiwG6tzZ1komWRp7Juw8Ciq6Kml2LBsHnHmq2eZZuesbR5kWloa2lpZn0%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>.
