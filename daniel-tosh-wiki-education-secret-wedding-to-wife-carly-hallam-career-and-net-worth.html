Known for his offensive and often controversial take on black comedy, he is the host of the Comedy Central TW show “Tosh.O”.</p><h2><span id=Early_Life>Early Life</span></h2><p>Daniel Tosh was born on the 29th of May 1975, in Boppard, Rhineland-Platinate, (then) West Germany, but grew up in Titusville, Florida. He is a mix of Scottish, Swiss and German, and a bit of American. He was raised by a Presbyterian father along with his three other siblings, an equally hilarious brother and two sisters. As a child, he suffered from social anxiety and obsessive-compulsive disorder, and his comedic stints have been his escape from his anxieties.</p><h2><span id=Education>Education</span></h2><p>He graduated from Astronaut High School in 1993 and unbeknown to most people, he did door-to-door salesmanship in his childhood days to help with the family expenses. He then took up a degree in marketing at the University of Central Florida, and graduated in 1996.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/affairpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/daniel_tosh_by_phil_mccarten_picturegroup_WEB-1024x687.jpg><h2><span id=Relationships>Relationships</span></h2><p>Daniel was very vocal when he was dating model Megan Abrigo back in 2009. Megan is a catwalk model and got famous after her appearance on NBC’s “Deal or No Deal”. They dated from 2009 until splitting-up in 2014, for no apparent reason, so fans were left speculating.</p><p>After the split, Daniel became very secretive of his dating life, until <a rel=nofollow href=#>TMZ</a> reported his secret marriage with Carly Hallam. They tied the knot on 15 April 2016, in a private ceremony held in Malibu. In an even more impressive feat than Cardi B and Offset who kept their marriage from the prying eyes of the public for nine months, Daniel and Carly kept their union under wraps for two long years! These two celebrities really know how to move under the radar, as they were also rarely photographed even when they were dating.</p><h2><span id=Daniel_Tosh_Wife_Carly_Hallam>Daniel Tosh’ Wife, Carly Hallam</span></h2><p>Carly Hallam was born on the 14th February 1985 in Florida, USA; she studied at Florida State University and graduated with English Honors in 2010, and as a writer worked on the Comedy Central channel for “Tosh.0” from 2012 to 2015. She also appeared on the show in various roles from 2012 to 2016. Carly is now working on the TV police series “Brooklyn Nine-Nine” production as a story editor.</p><p>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fbHbubjYmkw</p><h2><span id=Career>Career</span></h2><p>Daniel didn’t really have an easy breezy beginning to his <a rel=nofollow href=#>working career</a>. Before becoming what he is now, he was first a telemarketer at the Central Florida Research Park, but left that job when he realized that he just wasn’t one for office work. He shifted his interest to entertainment, and by 1998, had become a part of ‘Just for Laughs’ in Montreal, and toured with the comedy club.</p><p>His short stint in “The Late Show with David Letterman” in 2001was his biggest break, and after that other shows just followed, such as “Jimmy Kimmel Live!”, “The Tonight Show with Jay Leno”, “Loveline”, “Premium Blend”, and many more. He was like an overnight sensation – people loved his dark humor and satirical contents.</p><p>He also went on to do local comedy shows, radio shows, and even commercials. He is also an actor, and stars in his shows on Comedy Central, and has surely made a name for himself in the industry.</p><h2><span id=Net_Worth_and_Charities>Net Worth and Charities</span></h2><p>With his shows and tours, Daniel Tosh has a net worth estimated by authoritative sources of over $16 million as of early 2019. He has been included in Forbes’ top-earnings comedians list since 2011, with his income mainly coming from stage ticket sales, due to his ever-growing skills in stand-up comedy. He now lives in an apparently luxurious home in Redondo Beach, California with several cars in his huge garage.</p><p>As a <a rel=nofollow href=#>philanthropist,</a> he is active in charitable causes and movements. He participated in a show dedicated to the family of the deceased comedian Greg Giraldo, and did a show for the Alabama disaster victims, and gave earnings for the relief work. Aside from that, he participates in annual charity shows with fellow comedians.</p><p>CAPTION CHALLENGE WINNER: Pleeeease let it be just a fart.We picked the caption above from a comment left by Jaimis HouleThanks to everyone who submitted!
