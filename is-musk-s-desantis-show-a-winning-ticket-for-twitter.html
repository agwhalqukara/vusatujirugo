DeSantis is considered a credible challenger to seizing the Republican nomination from frontrunner Donald Trump in the 2024 election, and his tie-up with Musk's Twitter has generated buzz.
DeSantis's choice of outlet for his Wednesday announcement follows news that ousted Fox News star Tucker Carlson will move his show to Twitter, and Daily Wire, a conservative news outlet, has also said Twitter will host its video and podcasts."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

On the one hand, he would like to see Twitter win him back his $44 billion investment and to do that he will have to keep advertisers on board.</p><p class=align-left>But on the other hand, Musk wants to remain Musk.</p><p class=align-left>Major advertisers fled in droves after his takeover, unimpressed by the tycoon's mercurial behavior and the firing of thousands of people, many of whom scrubbed away bad content from Twitter.</p><p class=align-left>Initially, Musk set out to do without them, plugging an amped-up subscription service that would compensate for the loss of revenue.</p><p class=align-left>He also welcomed back banned accounts and shooed away the media establishment by branding top-tier news groups as state-affiliated media or removing authentication for the accounts of journalists and celebrities.</p><p class=align-left>But with his push to build a subscriber base flailing, Musk tacitly admitted defeat by poaching Linda Yaccarino as CEO.</p><p class=align-left>Yaccarino is one of the world’s best-respected ad executives, who built deep relationships with the world’s biggest brands as ad boss for NBCUniversal, the media group.</p><p class=align-left>But Musk still firmly insists on maintaining his free-wheeling inclinations that can include dabbling in conspiracy theories and far right tropes.</p><p class=align-left>Asked in a recent interview if he thought about the <a href=#>business</a> consequences of his uncontrolled behavior online, a clearly provoked Musk answered: "I don’t care!"</p><h2>'Anything is achievable'</h2><p class=align-left>Musk's critics believe that refusal to stay above the fray will deny him the trust of blue-chip advertisers.</p><p class=align-left>"The people that Musk is bringing on board are among the most disturbingly bigoted forces on the right," said Matt Gertz, senior fellow at the left-leaning Media Matters group.</p><p class=align-left>"The Yaccarino hiring and this are contradictory -- these are moves you make if you want to cultivate a subscriber base of far right extremists, not if you want to make money off of advertising," Gertz said.</p><p class=align-left>Others, however, point out that conservatives have managed to carve out a way to make big money from media.</p><p class=align-left>"Profits have always been the priority ...(and Musk) is tapping into a model that has been successful on talk <a href=#>radio</a> and Fox News," said Kathryn C. Brownell, assistant professor at Purdue University.</p><p class=align-left>Moreover, Fox News dominance of US TV news is currently in a rough patch.</p><p class=align-left>If it doesn't work, Musk will more than likely have to fork out more money to back Twitter.</p><p class=align-left>"Anything is achievable when you're a billionaire in that regard. If he wants to pour another $40 billion into creating Twitter News, that's the only way it could really work," said Roy Gutterman, Syracuse University professor and director at the Tully Center for Free Speech.</p><p class=align-left>"To have even a quasi news outlet, you're still going to need a pretty costly infrastructure...Fox News didn't develop overnight," he added.</p><p>Source: AFP</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiaop6yp7jYZ5qoZqqWfKPB0qKlnqujYrKku82opLJnYWt9coSUZqCsZZ2qwKy%2FjJ2crJmeqba0edKhprBlkWLEqrrNoqWgZaSesKyx02abqKWRnruggo4%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
