After all, rules are rules.
The NBA made an allowance for Bryant to be on hand before the game because it was the Heat’s only visit this season to Denver. Suspended players are typically not allowed to be present at the arena on game nights."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

Bryant was engulfed at half-court by Nikola Jokic and the Nuggets.</p><p>Bryant soaked in the moment as he slipped the ring on his hand. He tapped at his heart in appreciation as the crowd cheered.</p><p>“It’s just a way of thanking him for all his contributions,” Nuggets coach Michael Malone said of the ceremony before the game. “Great to see Thomas — haven’t seen him obviously since we won it all last June.”</p><p>Right after the ring ceremony, Bryant exited the building. He was wrapping up a three-game suspension for his involvement in an altercation against New Orleans last week.</p><p>Bryant played sparingly for Denver after being acquired in February 2023 from the Los Angeles Lakers as part of a four-team trade. He only briefly played in one game in the postseason Denver’s run.</p><p>The Nuggets handed out their championship rings on Oct. 24, right before playing their first game of the season against LeBron James and the Lakers. The team has honored other players on last year’s championship roster who made a return to the Mile High City with their new team. It’s a list that included Bruce Brown, Ish Smith and Jeff Green.</p><p>Bryant signed with the Heat as a free agent over the summer. He’s averaging 4.2 points and 3.1 rebounds over 25 games for Miami.</p><h2>___</h2><p>AP NBA: <span class=LinkEnhancement><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style=LinkEnhancementA href=# rel=noopener>https://apnews.com/hub/NBA</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiZoKOyuL%2BNnKamZ5Gnwaqvy55mraCfoq60ecGrsJqmpGK%2FqrrGZqWbmV1tr3mDlZqZnXBiaLOlfsVyaGlwaJmuo4SUmmyfamRusQ%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
