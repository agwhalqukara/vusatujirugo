Creative energy is often really harnessed when shared, and the relationship between Hunter S. Thompson and Ralph Steadman is no exception. Virtually anything that Thompson produced during his career featured Steadman’s wonderfully bizarre illustrations, which greatly complemented the out-there, Gonzo brand of journalism that Thompson pioneered in the latter quarter of the 20th century."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

Thompson and Ralph Steadman is no exception. Virtually anything that Thompson produced during his career featured Steadman’s wonderfully bizarre illustrations, which greatly complemented the out-there, Gonzo brand of journalism that Thompson pioneered in the latter quarter of the 20th century.</p><p>Steadman’s images are instantly recognizable to anyone familiar with the enigma that was Hunter S. Thompson. And thanks to Johnny Depp’s brilliant portrayal of Thompson in 1998’s <a href=# rel=noopener>Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas</a>, another generation was introduced to the often misunderstood writer as well as Steadman’s sensory twisting and thought provoking drawings.</p><p>Not only is Steadman’s work used for the Criterion Edition cover art of the film, but <a href=# rel=noopener>Fear and Loathing</a> director Terry Gilliam thoughtfully (and effectively) assaulted the audience with Steadman’s often drug-fueled images throughout the film.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-41956 alt="Ralph Steadman Fear And Loathing Art" width=700 height=851 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/ralph-steadman-vintage-gonz.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-41956 class=wp-caption-text><a href=#>pixgood</a></p><p>The Gonzo movement was a combination of journalism such as Thompson’s–written without claiming objectivity, and intentionally rebellious–and experimental artwork that often had a political edge, unapologetically furthering the agenda or viewpoints of the artists. The iconic pairing of Steadman and Thompson came about in 1970, when Scanlan’s Monthly hired UK-based Steadman instead of a photographer to accompany Thompson to cover the Kentucky Derby.</p><p>When the duo was unable to see the actual race from their seats, the article transformed into a scathing account of the event itself and the people who comprised it, and introduced a new era of journalism to the masses.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-41957 alt="Ralph Steadman Working" width=900 height=506 data-sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/ralph-steadman-artist-working.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-41957 class=wp-caption-text><a href=#>Vanity Fair</a></p><p><a href=# rel=noopener>The Kentucky Derby Is Decadent and Depraved</a> became the world’s first taste of Gonzo journalism, as it would be described by Boston Globe editor Bill Cardoso. The phrase was coined and the collaborations between the two would continue for another 35 years. Likewise, Ralph Steadman’s career has spanned many decades, publications and media outlets. Whatever project he is currently working on, you can always see the artist in his work.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-41958 alt="Illustration Of Hunter S.

I’d get as crazy as I could but I’d do the job. I did what I was being paid to do, or not paid to do. Half the time I never got paid, but it was something to do.”</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-41961 alt="Ralph Steadman No Knickers" width=900 height=618 data-sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/ralph-steadman-no-knickers.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-41961 class=wp-caption-text><a href=#>KLFM</a></p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-41963 alt="Drawings By Ralph Steadman" width=900 height=637 data-sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/ralph-steadman-cycle-demon.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-41963 class=wp-caption-text><a href=#>Wonderland Magazine</a></p><p>So what did Thompson, who died in 2005, think of Steadman upon meeting him? “All I knew about him was that this was his first visit to the United States. And the more I pondered the fact, the more it gave me fear. How would he bear up under the heinous culture shock of being lifted out of London and plunged into the drunken mob scene at the Kentucky Derby? There was no way of knowing.”</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-41964 alt="Ralph Steadman Art Print" width=900 height=726 data-sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/ralph-steadman-bud-print.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-41964 class=wp-caption-text><a href=#>Luc Devroye</a></p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-41965 alt="Drawing Of Hunter S.
