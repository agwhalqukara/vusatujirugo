He championed the medicinal qualities of marijuana, and emphasized the benefits of legalizing it.</p><p>“They used to say, ‘You smoke that stuff, boy, you get hooked!'” Freeman told The Daily Beast. “My first wife got me into it many years ago.”</p><p>The Million Dollar Baby star married his first wife <strong>Jeanette Adair Bradshaw</strong> in the 1960s. He split from Bradshaw in the late 1970s, going on to marry second wife <strong>Myrna Colley-Lee</strong> in 1984, before the two divorced in the late 2000s.</p><p>“How do I take it? However it comes!” Freeman continued of marijuana, years after he became a single man once more. “I’ll eat it, drink it, smoke it, snort it!”</p><p>“This movement is really a long time coming, and it’s getting legs — longer legs.” Freeman added of the recent political support for decriminalization and wider access to pot. “Now, the thrust is understanding that alcohol has no real medicinal use. Maybe if you have one drink it’ll quiet you down, but two or three and you’re f–ked.”</p><p>The Lucy actor told The Daily Beast that he has found his own benefits in weed, after <a href=# rel=noopener>suffering a horrific car crash</a> in 2008. The accident left him with pain and trouble in his left hand and arm.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>“Marijuana has many useful uses,” Freeman said. “I have fibromyalgia pain in this arm, and the only thing that offers any relief is marijuana. They’re talking about kids who have grand mal seizures, and they’ve discovered that marijuana eases that down to where these children can have a life. That right there, to me, says, ‘Legalize it across the board!'”</p><p>“And what negative effects does it have?” he added. “Look at Woodstock 1969. They said, ‘We’re not going to bother them or say anything about smoking marijuana,’ and not one problem or fight.”</p><p>Freeman previously touched on his support for legalization in a <a href=# rel=noopener>2012 interview with Newsweek</a>, telling the magazine, “It’s just the stupidest law possible, given history. You don’t stop people from doing what they want to do, so forget about making it unlawful. You’re just making criminals out of people who aren’t engaged in criminal activity. And we’re spending zillions of dollars trying to fight a war we can’t win! We could make zillions, just legalize it and tax it like we do liquor. It’s stupid.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vJloZrCvp2PCtLnAoJizoZ6ae6S7zGianqSVl7%2BqwNhmpZ6vo2S7psPSaKSoqpeWu26y0Z6cppmeYsSquMtmnJqsXai6sLfEZqqnp6Kpeq6t0aKhrpmelnqtscaao6KylWK2tXmRaWhuaWFq</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
