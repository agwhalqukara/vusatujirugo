The Walkley Award-winning Scottish-born podcaster, 69, has become a mainstay with the public broadcaster over the past four decades and one of Australia’s most polarising figures during the pandemic.
A regular across ABC’s news and current affairs programs, Dr Swan has courted controversy as he repeatedly called for tough restrictions to combat the virus."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

China as an example of how not to handle the current stage of the pandemic</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Dr Swan said surging cases should prompt a rethink on earlier doubts about the value of a fourth round of vaccines.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Each additional round of jabs was becoming less effective at combating a virus&nbsp; that had mutated significantly since the vaccinations were developed, and each subsequent strain of Covid was proving to be less potent even if more contagious, but yet Dr Swan backed a fourth injection.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>‘Pfizer say that they’ve developed an Omicron-specific vaccine which we were sceptical about… saying Omicron’s going to be over, well maybe Omicron’s not going to be over and therefore a fourth dose with an Omicron-specific vaccine might actually be quite handy this year,’ he said.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Dr Swan made it clear he didn’t foresee a fourth dose ‘for the general public’, but instead for ‘a wider group’ of vulnerable people such as over-65s and anyone with a suppressed immune system.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Dr Swan said Covid is ‘not yet seasonal’ – despite a widely-held perception that the virus spreads more when people are forced indoors by cooler weather, which is believed to have happened in Melbourne and western Sydney during last winter’s Delta outbreak.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Dr Nick Coatsworth, Australia’s former Deputy Chief Medical Officer, is among those to criticise Dr Swan’s ongoing calls for tougher restrictions.</p><img decoding=async id=i-7ec0e6367d41d168

protecting the vulnerable.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Last month, Dr Swan pointed to China as an example of how not to handle the current stage of the pandemic.</p><p
