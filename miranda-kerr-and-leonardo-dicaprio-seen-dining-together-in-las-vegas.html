That’s how long supermodel Miranda Kerr and ex-husband <a href=#>Orlando Bloom</a> were married before they announced their split last month (granted they were separated for several months). Miranda seems to be bouncing back with ease as various media reports are revealing <a href=#>she and heartthrob Leonardo DiCaprio were spotted having dinner</a> in Las Vegas having dinner…. with friends.</p><p>Eyewitnesses of the dinner said, ‘They looked like they were having a great time. They came with a bunch of friends and were overheard talking about going out the night before.” The two were accompanied by about 15 friends including Alicia Keys’ husband Swizz Beats. For now, there were no reports of anything romantic or even flirting, but the two do have a romantic history and it IS <a href=#>Leonardo Dicaprio</a>.</p><p>Meanwhile, Orlando was in New York City presenting an award at the Artios Awards at the XL Nightclub. A source said that Orlando stayed the entire night, presented an award, and took the time to get some pictures taken by media and fans. It was noted how ‘down to earth’ he was by a source close to the event. We’re big fans of Orlando so hopefully he’s doing OK!</p><p>Photo by Neilson Barnard/Getty Images for Jaguar Land Rover</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo77IrbCtp5%2BXe6S7zGikoqqRo7GiecqeqatlnJq8r63RnaZmnJmYrrG%2ByKhkrJ2Vo3qltc2ipaBlpKS0psDHnqlmpJGoerexxpqqaA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
