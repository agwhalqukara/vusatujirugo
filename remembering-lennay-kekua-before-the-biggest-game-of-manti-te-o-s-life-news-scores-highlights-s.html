Lennay Kekua, the longtime girlfriend of Notre Dame linebacker Manti Te’o, passed away on September 11, 2012 after losing an extended battle with leukemia. 
Prior to her passing, the 22-year-old Stanford student made her boyfriend promise two things: that he wouldn’t miss any football because of her condition, and that he give her a bouquet of white roses after she was gone."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

Both were unaware of Kekua’s condition until she was involved in a serious car accident her sophomore year, and testing during her recuperation period in the hospital spotted cancerous cells in her blood.</p><p>Devastated but not destroyed, Te’o drew on the strength and courage Kekua had shown in her final months and continued to play on through his period of mourning—keeping his final promise to her and taking the field against Michigan on September 22, the day of Kekua’s funeral. Te’o <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">told reporters</a>:</p><p>I knew when they were going to close the casket,&nbsp;It was during walkthrough. I remember I asked Coach [Bob]&nbsp;Diaco, "Coach, what time is it?" And he said "It’s 12:01."</p><p>That would be 9:01 California time, and nine o’clock is when they closed the casket for my girlfriend. So I had a moment then.</p><p>Te’o would go on to make eight tackles and snag two interceptions against the Wolverines in front of a crowd of Notre Dame fans, many of whom wore Hawaiian leis in support of their star player whose whole life had been turned upside down in the past week.</p><p>Te’o “sent” his two interceptions to Kekua, along with a single bouquet of white flowers he had placed on her grave.</p><p>Te’o’s continued excellence at linebacker this season established him as a Heisman frontrunner and helped elevate Notre Dame’s football team to a 12-0 record and the No. 1 ranking in the land.</p><p>Tonight Te’o and the Fighting Irish look to extend that record to a perfect 13-0 and beat the Alabama Crimson Tide for the program’s first national title since 1988.</p><p>Win or lose, I think we all know Lennay Kekua will be smiling down on the Irish tonight, and Te’o will do his very best to honor her for his last time in the blue and gold of Notre Dame.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmianJqupLTEq6meqJ%2BnwW%2BvzqZmmqqknrCtsdJoaG1vZGmCennRnqSepZKav6q6xmajnqaelsZut8SkrJplkpqzsL7EZquhnV2XtqizxKyrZp%2BRorJuu8VmpJqmpJ56tbHOrGSloZaa</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
