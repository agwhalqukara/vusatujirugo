They may have left their respective seasons heartbroken, but now they have the chance to fly to a romantic paradise in the hopes of converting a prospective summer fling into the real thing.”</p><p dir=ltr lang=en><a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="external noopener noreferrer">#BachelorInParadise</a>. Where love feels better. ❤️ Experience the drama, heartbreak, and love stories, starting Tuesday at 8/7c on ABC and Stream on Hulu. <a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="external noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/JRQH8G3ZmK</a></p><p>— Bachelor in Paradise (@BachParadise) <a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="external noopener noreferrer">September 21, 2022</a></p><h2>Everything you need to know about the Season 8 premiere of Bachelor in Paradise (episode 1)</h2><p>The season begins with a two-hour-long super-sized episode starring 19 people who have previously competed on both The Bachelor and The Bachelorette, but the route to love isn’t what they’re accustomed to.&nbsp;Instead of one individual giving out roses, each candidate gets their own on Bachelor in Paradise. Every competitor may present a rose to someone else, and towards the conclusion of the program, numerous engagements are possible.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Bachelor-In-Paradise-1.jpg alt="Bachelor In Paradise" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>The program had a rotating panel of hosts last season. Jesse Palmer returns as a full-time solo host this season. The current season of Bachelor in Paradise will, as the video implies, take a leaf from the Love Island playbook by moving the female cast to another destination mid-season to mingle with five new single men, while the men will remain at the beach and be introduced to five new women.</p><p>The program will begin with 16 female and 14 male members; the men will each give a rose to the ladies of their choosing, and the two women who do not get a rose will be sent home. To keep things interesting, the producers will replace the two ladies who have been culled with two male members. The process will continue until the conclusion, with each alternate episode featuring one gender at risk of returning home and being replaced.</p><p>Shanae Ankney, Genevieve Parisi, Jill Chin, Sierra Jackson, Hailey Malles, Teddi Wright, Serene Russell, Kira Mengistu, Hunter Haag, Andrew Spencer, Justin Glaze, Michael Allio, Logan Palmer, Jacob Rapini, Brittany Galvin, Romeo Alexander, Lace Jones, Brandon Jones, and Casey Woods are the contestants set to appear on Bachelor in Paradise.</p><p>While everyone is hoping for love, some of the cast members have their sights set on certain people. Andrew said that he wants to see Teddi at the villa, while Kira is looking forward to meeting Romeo on the beach. The one member in the cast that everyone is looking forward to seeing is Wells.</p><p>Wells Adams takes the viewer on a tour of what to anticipate from season 8 in a sneak look posted on social media, and the footage is as dramatic as the season is promised to be. He stated:</p><p>“You come to paradise to live, laugh, and fall in love. Because we all need it.”</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Bachelor-In-Paradise.jpeg alt="Bachelor In Paradise" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>He went on to say:</p><p>“In a location like this, sadness feels nice. These are significant tales.”</p><p>Keep an eye on ABC on Tuesday, September 27 at 8 p.m. ET to see what happens when these individuals get together on Bachelor in Paradise.</p><h2 class=screen-reader-text>Post navigation</h2><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiamaS0s63PobCgoaOpe6S7zGiZmpuYmrmwvoyipWaokaeupbXSnmSsnZGovK95l2agrGWjmsFuwM5mmZ5lopq5pq3Snptmp55irqOvjJyfmqaemrluv86opWg%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
