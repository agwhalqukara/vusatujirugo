[Flipping the bird] was her instant reaction to being disrespected. That joke was way over the line, having her husband’s past thrown in her face like that with everyone watching was such a cheap shot. Of course, it got her mad, and it had nothing to do with Kim. She was mad at [Levi] for making the joke.”</p><p>The insider shared: “Princess feels like Ray J is so much more than that tape, and everyone should be past this moment of his life by now. She just hated to be part of the [MTV Movie & TV Awards] in such a crappy way. She wanted to have fun, and she felt like she was attacked, which always sucks.”</p><p>Advertisement</p><p>Princess and her husband have a bright daughter.</p><p></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo77IrbCipqOesaa%2BjaipoGeilsZuttJmo5qcmZrAbrzRoqWcnaOoeq271Z5kmqaUYq%2BirthmpJ6kn5nGbrrOq66op5RixKat0WakmqyTnbavs4ydqZ6ro5rAbrXNZqWer12ltqTA1KucZpmjYsGpsYympqZlnZa4pr%2BMqZyam5VixKrAx2ajmqyVqMFut8imZKSZopmutLTImqVmnKKWuqJ5kXJwbW9nZA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
