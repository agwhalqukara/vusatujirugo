After dating on and off-again for five years, Jersey Shore couple <strong><a href=#>Ronnie Ortiz-Magro</a></strong> and <strong><a href=#>Sammi "Sweetheart" Giancola</a></strong> have broken up — for good, he tells <strong><a href=#>Us Weekly</a></strong>.</p><p>"Me and Sammi aren't together anymore," Magro told <strong>Us </strong><strong>Wednesday, Aug. 20,&nbsp;</strong>at the premiere of his former costar <strong><a href=#>JWoww</a></strong>'s new movie, Jersey Shore Massacre (in theaters on Friday, Aug. 22, and on VOD/DVD/Blu-ray on Aug 26). The couple split about two months ago, but still remain amicable.</p><p>"We just grew our separate ways," the 28-year-old MTV star explained of his ex, 27. "She's still a great person. I love her as a person and I care about her but we went our separate ways. That's it."</p><p>Magro and Giancola split and reconciled <a href=#>numerous times</a> on the popular reality show, which chronicled their tumultuous romance from 2009 to 2012.</p><p>"At the end of the day, we went through a lot of stuff together," Magro said of his ex-love. "We have a lot of history so I keep her close."</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>So does this mean he's dating? "No," Magro said. "I'm not dating anyone. Just sticking to being an Uncle [to <strong><a href=#>Snooki</a></strong> and JWoww's kids, <strong>Lorenzo </strong>and <strong>Meilani</strong>]." Proud "Uncle Ronnie" further gushed about JWoww's <a href=#>newborn daughter</a> to <strong>Us</strong>. "She's beautiful," he emphasized of little Meilani. "She's like, 'I need attention! Look at me, look at me!' And I'm looking and playing." (The star still remains close to his castmates, although he isn't actually related to them by blood.)</p><p>Aside from being an uncle to moving on from his ex, Magro has been "sharpening" his skills as an actor. "I'm actually in school right now at UCB for improv," he told <strong>Us</strong>. "I'm on my second level. I'm actually going to scene study as well for acting."</p><p>The former reality star referred to his training as "sharpening my tools as opposed to just jumping in." He added: "I have about two more years left and then we'll see what happens."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vJloZrCvp2PCtLnAoJizoZ6ae6S7zGianqSVl7%2BqwNhmpZ6vo2S7psPSaKGeqqOaxm6%2Fx6ipnmWipLuvtcRmpqusma96rq3Gq6ZmmZ6ZerStzKagZp%2BZlruku8uaZKyonJ7BbrDErZiipKNif3F9k2tncQ%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
