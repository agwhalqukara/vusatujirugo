This included Daniels, North Carolina's Drake Maye, Washington's Michael Penix Jr. and Michigan's J.J.

Daniels completed 72.2 percent of his passes for 3,812 yards and 40 touchdowns, adding another 1,134 yards on the ground while finding the end zone 10 more times as a runner.</p>ESPN <span class=acct>@espn</span><p lang=nl dir=ltr>JAYDEN DANIELS, WOW ðŸ˜¤ &lt;a href="https://t.co/9UcGy5H5K6">pic.twitter.com/9UcGy5H5K6&lt;/a></p><p>B/R NFL Scout <a href=#>Derrik Klassen</a> was impressed with Daniels' pocket presence to go along with his tremendous athleticism in his scouting report.</p><p>"Overall, Daniels has an exciting floor as a prospect," Klassen wrote. "He is a veteran-like presence in the pocket, and he's far and away the best athlete in the class at the position. Daniels' average arm talent and inconsistent accuracy may limit his ceiling, but it's hard to imagine him totally flaming out."</p><p>Daniels should hear his name called early when the draft begins on April 25, although his reported preference to avoid Washington may cause him to slip past the No. 2 pick.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmianJqupLTEq6meqJ%2BnwW%2BvzqZmmqqknrCtsdJoaGlpYWyEcYOMrJqhnZapsrN5yZqwnZ2eYrGiusieo6xlmJbAbq3NZqCnrJWnsrTAjKKlZpqVnruoecOrmJ%2BslZl6o8WMp6anZZOkuq6tzZ2cq6tdqbKiuQ%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>.
