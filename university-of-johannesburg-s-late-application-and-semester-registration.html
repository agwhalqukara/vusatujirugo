However, this does not always happen, hence the reason some universities have courses and programs available for late application. The University of Johannesburg, like most universities, has certain policies that guide the late application service.</p><p>In addition to that, they also have very easy and convenient ways of carrying out semester registration for both old and new students. All you have to do is follow the laid-down instructions and you would be good in not less than five minutes.</p><h2><strong>Late Applications at&nbsp;</strong><strong>The University of Johannesburg is Done Online</strong></h2><p>The University of Johannesburg (UJ) is among the institutions of higher learning in South Africa that accepts late applications from applicants who are interested in studying various courses. However, unlike some universities, UJ only conducts its late application processes online. They do not allow walk-ins and sometimes close the system at an earlier stage depending on the volume and quality of late application inquiries received.</p><p>For more information on UJ’s late application service, call the university’s call center on 011 559 4555.</p><h2><strong>The Late Application Process</strong></h2><p>Nobody loves lateness in anything. But, if for some reason you fail to apply with your peers at the <a href=# data-wpel-link=internal>University of Johannesburg</a>, their late application option is available to make it up. This option allows you to get registered and study at the time you want. All you have to do is to meet their requirements and then provide the necessary items or files for registration, get cleared and you are good to go.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/buzzsouthafrica.com/wp-content/uploads/uj3-e1620052606297.jpg><p>It is pertinent to note that late application at UJ is done online only. You cannot register for the program offline. In fact, one of the university’s policies on this program is that walk-ins are not allowed, even for late inquiries, as everything is done online.</p><p>Once you apply late for any course at UJ, there are certain things you need to know. These things will help you get yourself prepared for the next phase and also provide answers to questions you might have in the future. They can be found below:</p><ul><li>Once you apply, UJ will release the final grade 12 results after which they will conduct the final selection of candidates.</li><li>Once they are done, they will go ahead to inform applicants of the outcome of their application status within 5 working days. This can be done via e-mail or SMS.</li><li>UJ strongly advises applicants not to visit any campus to confirm their final application status, even if they have not received an SMS or e-mail within the stipulated 5 working days from the release of the final grade 12 results.</li><li>To enquire whether UJ still has space in a particular qualification, you must use the late application inquiry system.</li><li>Similarly, if you want to change to another course, you must use the late application inquiry system too.</li><li>Only qualifications the university has space available for will be made available on the late inquiry system for applicants who eventually meet the minimum entrance requirements.</li></ul><p><strong>NB:</strong> To verify your application, all you have to do is to call the UJ Call Centre on 011 559 4555 for more information or follow the <a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">link</a>.</p><h3><strong>Step-by-Step Guide on How To Apply</strong></h3><p lang=en dir=ltr>Short Learning Programme in Law and 4IR</p><p>This programme introduces students to the intersection between law and the Fourth Industrial Revolution.</p><p>More info here: <a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">https://t.co/DwEzw5jEa0</a> <a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/v2vbhT2DFL</a></p><p>— University of Johannesburg (@go2uj) <a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">March 10, 2021</a></p><ul><li>You will start first by submitting either your UJ student number, Grade 12 examination number, or ID number and click on submit.</li><li>Go ahead to verify your personal details and then click on confirm.</li><li>On a new or previous application confirmation, the system will indicate whether you qualify for any available qualification if you have never applied at the institution.
