She corrected them and said, “I’m not Mexican at all. I’m West Indian and I’m Dominican. I speak Spanish because I’m Dominican. And it’s like, so what’s the difference between Dominican and Mexican?’ And it’s like, everything!”</p><p>“People just don’t be understanding s—, ” she adds. “It’s like, ‘Cardi’s Latin, she’s not black.’ And it’s like, ‘Bro, my features don’t come from … white people f–king, OK?’ And they always wanna race-bait when it comes to me. … I have Afro features. ‘Oh, but your parents are light-skinned … all right, but my grandparents aren’t.”</p><p>Cardi explained that her maternal and paternal grandfathers have green eyes. She said her father’s mother is light-skinned but “a little darker than me” and her mother’s mom is “really, really dark.”</p><p>“People from the Caribbean islands, it’s a mixture,” she says. “It was one of the first places the slaves were taken to — especially the Dominican Republic … and people don’t be knowing that s—. They just be so confused and they wanna dictate your race so bad. It’s like, bro, pick up a passport and pick up a book so you can f–king know!”</p><p>Regardless of the rapper breaking down the differences between race, nationality, and ethnicity, many folks who caught her message maintained that Cardi is not a Black woman while some came agreed with her.</p><p>“Cardi is a black latina.”</p><p>“I don’t like her music but she is 💯 percent right slave trade was a world affair.”</p><p>“She’s not African.. she’s is mixed. Mixed people cannot be black.. she benefits from black culture that’s all. ”</p><p>” Tell them, baby, tell them!!”</p><p>“She has never identified herself as black person, so what made her change her mind?? She’s has even called black girls roaches.”<br></p><figure class="wp-block-embed-instagram wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram">https://www.instagram.com/p/BzJf7xsl08O/</figure><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiZpKGur8DAm6Oam5uowaK%2BjZympmdiZX56e49vZmtuX5ius7DIZplmq5%2Bqu6W%2FjKidn2Wfo3qzrcKeZJqmlGK7osDIqKWapJmpxm6tjKWmrWWfm3qxsc6po55llKS7tXnKp6awZaSdsm6wyJ%2BdnqqVo7Cmew%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
