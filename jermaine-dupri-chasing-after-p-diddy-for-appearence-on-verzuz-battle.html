Fans have gotten to see some of their favorite rappers and producers perform their biggest songs, and while there are many appearances, certain performers choose not to participate.</p><p>https://www.instagram.com/tv/CFOCF8rnw7d/</p><p>In the past, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">P. Diddy</a> said he considered the idea of going up against Dr. Dre, although, this has never come to fruition. Additionally, it’s been reported that Jermaine Dupri has been chasing after Diddy to get a Verzuz battle.</p><p>During his time on The Fat Joe Show, Jermaine explained why he thought that Sean Combs, also known as P. Diddy, was the perfect opponent for him. While speaking to Fat Joe, he said, “I’m for the culture, whatever the culture wants.”</p><p>When asked by Joe if he would like to perform against Diddy, Dupri said he would do it for sure. He added, “we gonna break the f*cking internet.” Diddy hasn’t responded to the request yet, but it would definitely be a big battle.</p><p>As it was noted above, not everyone is thrilled at the idea of appearing on Verzuz. Nas, the legendary creator of Illmatic, previously said he was a big fan of Verzuz but he’s not interested in participating. Nas said Timbaland and Swizz Beats know that as well.</p><p>Jermaine Dupri, on the other hand, has been in the news for other reasons, including when he touched on his romance with Janet Jackson. Jermaine and Jackson dated for approximately seven years until they split up in 2009.</p><p>Advertisement</p><p>Fans of Jackson know she rarely reveals any information on her personal life, so it’s always a surprise when someone talks about her intimate life. According to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Dupri</a>, he and Jackson met at one of her concerts at The Omni.</p><p></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo77IrbCipqOesaa%2BjaipoGeamr%2BurcinnGacpaW%2FqnnCoZisoZ6ceqKy056pZqhdmbalsNhmnaiqXZa9sbHAq5ynm5VivK951Z6ps62qYq%2BiwNOlnGZsY22AdoOO</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
