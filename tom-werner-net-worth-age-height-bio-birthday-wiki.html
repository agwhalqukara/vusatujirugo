Economic circumstances changed, however, after Jackson won a $2.1-million arbitration award in February. Refunds were offered to ticket holders involved in the lawsuit.</p><h2>Who is Tom Werner Dating?</h2><p>According to our records, <strong>Tom Werner</strong> married to <strong>Jill Werner </strong>.
