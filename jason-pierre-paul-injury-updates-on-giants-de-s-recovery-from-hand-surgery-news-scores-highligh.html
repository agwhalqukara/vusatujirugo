Details of Pierre-Paul's Surgery Emerge
Tuesday, Jan. 19
Paul Schwartz of the New York Post reported Dr. Robert Hotchkiss, who is the Giants' hand specialist, performed the procedure, which was done to help Pierre-Paul's grip:
The surgery, Pierre-Paul explained in late December, would concentrate on his right middle finger, which was turned into a bloated, oversized and largely unusable digit as a result of the July 4 fireworks accident that did permanent damage to his right hand."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

With more time to recover from his hand injury and a full preseason to prepare, he would be expected to bounce back and be far more productive in 2016.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmianJqupLTEq6meqJ%2BnwW%2BvzqZmmqqknrCtsdJoaW9oaG2Ad3nJmqqopl2ltqa%2B0Z5kqZmloXqqusmuqbJlpaWxosDErGSopl2ctqK606xknZ2jYr%2Bmr86vnKuxXZu%2FsLmMoZinnF2owrOzxKuw</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
