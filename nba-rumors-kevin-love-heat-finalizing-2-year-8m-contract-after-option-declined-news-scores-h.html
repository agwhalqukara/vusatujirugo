He averaged 8.5 points and 6.0 rebounds per game in 76 appearances for Miami.</p><p>Miami entered this offseason in a difficult cap situation. The team was <a href=# rel=noopener>set</a> to be over the first apron, leaving it positioned to be hard-capped if it used the $5.2 million taxpayer mid-level exception in free agency.</p><p>Heat president Pat Riley even appeared to <a href=# rel=noopener>express</a> some frustration publicly with Jimmy Butler during his end-of-season press conference.</p><p>For a team that has been defined by stability for decades, this is the first offseason in a long time where the Heat had a lot of things to figure out for their short- and long-term future.</p><p>Love is only been a short-term option for the franchise, but they know him as well as any team in the NBA right now.
