Kim Kardashian tried to copy sister Kourtney Kardashian’s maternity style in 2012 and 2013 and admits it was a huge mistake. 
“Everyone used to say Kourtney had the best pregnancy style, so I would borrow a dress she wore when she was pregnant, and OMG it did not look the same!” Kardashian, 34, wrote on her newly launched website, KimKardashianWest.com. “I also look back at my last pregnancy looks and sometimes I am mortified."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

I actually want to accentuate it,” she wrote.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>And she’s definitely not apologizing for sticking with the same pregnancy uniform. “And yes, long coats to cover my fat arms and ass!” the star said. “It’s such a trip how your body grows and changes, and at the end of the day, you have to wear what you are comfortable in and what you feel good in. I don’t care what the weather is, I will always wear my coats. I am always freezing, so it works out perfectly for me!”</p><p>The wife of <strong>Kanye West</strong> also admits that she has already gained more weight now than she did with North. “I actually am a few pounds heavier this pregnancy than my last, yet somehow I look so different. Maybe it’s because you carry a boy differently than a girl, maybe it’s because I don’t have the swelling that I had last time when I had preeclampsia, OR maybe it’s because I am confident in my style and know what to expect,” she said.</p><p>What do you think of Kardashian’s maternity style comments?
