On Saturday, Aug. 22, she gave voice to one of those questions via Instagram, writing a heartbreaking note to the Nirvana rocker about their daughter, <strong>Frances Bean</strong>, now 23.&nbsp;</p><p>Love, 51, took to the photo-sharing app with <a href=#>a stunning throwback picture</a> of herself, Cobain, and their then-baby girl, who wasn't even 2 years old when the grunge icon died at age 27. The snap — from the December 1992 issue of Spin magazine — shows the family of three lounging in bed together.&nbsp;</p><p>"Makes me feel so sad," the Hole rocker captioned the photo. "Our baby is all grown up now. Jesus, Kurt, look at her face, what on earth were you thinking…!?!? God I miss you, we all miss you. #family #memories #turnbacktime #lovehim"</p><p>Cobain's death has weighed heavily on Love's mind since the debut of HBO's documentary Kurt Cobain: Montage of Heck earlier this year. The movie was her idea, but she told director Brett Morgen that watching it "f–ked [her] up."&nbsp;</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>"I remembered the sexual relationship, which, as you know, is the core of any good marriage," the "Celebrity Skin" singer shared. "It almost rendered other intimacies meaningless. I remembered how much I love him, and it made me think about a few other people I don't want to name, but a few other people I've been in love with. And should I have married them? The answer is actually no."</p><p>(Cobain was Love's second husband. She was also previously married to rocker James Moreland.)</p><p>"Nobody else was as funny," she added. "Nobody else was as compatible and got my jokes. And you can see it in the film…It kind of f–ked me up, and to be honest with you, I don't have a boyfriend right now, so I'm single. [The film] made me really evaluate what, at the age of 50, I want out of a relationship. He's a hard act to follow. I love him and I always will."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vJloZrCvp2PCtLnAoJizoZ6ae6S7zGianqSVl7%2BqwNhmpZ6vo2S7psPSaJqoraKpu6bFjKWmr51dpbKvv4yhnJqqpJe%2Fpq3KoqWgZZ6kwaZ506hkpK2iqXqku8GaoKdlYmV%2Bdn6TcQ%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
