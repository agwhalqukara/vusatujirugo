As reported earlier this week, the Real Housewives of Atlanta star is pregnant with the couple's first child — and she couldn't be happier!</p><p>"If you follow RHOA you know that Todd and I went over a lot of hurdles to conceive," the singer-songwriter, 39, tells <strong>Us Weekly</strong> of her hubby of more than a year. (They married in a televised wedding in April 2014.)</p><p>Indeed, while both Burruss and Tucker have kids from previous relationships — she's mom to daughter Riley, and he's dad to daughter Kaela — they faced fertility struggles on Season 7 of RHOA.</p><p>Earlier this year, the Bravo-lebrities opened up about their difficulties during an interview with Dr. Oz on his daytime TV show. "It's tough. It's frustrating," Tucker admitted at the time. "'Cause I know it has to [weigh] on her emotionally. You know, just, 'What's wrong with me, why can't I get pregnant, how do we fix it?'"</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>The couple sought out the advice of medical experts for assistance. "We chose in vitro to help and found out it wasn't 100 percent guaranteed, so when we found out that our procedure WAS successful you can't imagine our joy!" the second-time mom-to-be tells <strong>Us</strong>. "Our family could now be complete with the addition of our baby love."</p><p>Burruss' TV family is excited to welcome the little one, too. "Congratulations to Kandi and Todd!" her costar <strong>Cynthia Bailey</strong> tells <strong>Us</strong>. "A new baby is a beautiful and joyous new beginning. May God continue to bless your marriage and fill it with love."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vJloZrCvp2PCtLnAoJizoZ6ae6S7zGianqSVl7%2BqwNhmpKilo2S7psPSaKKappSeeqPB0ausrKtdpL2mutJmrKllkZe8tsCMqamen56Wu6TFjLKmrmWTlru1ecimmKChnpp6sMHRZqGosV1nfXKBkW1u</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
