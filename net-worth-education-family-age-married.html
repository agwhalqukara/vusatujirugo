She didn’t come to Alaska together with Glenn, but joined him four months later. The two married in 2001 and welcomed their first child, Willow Leaves in May 2006. The two were living in Fairbanks for 15 months after Silvia’s birth, as it wasn’t safe for a newborn to be living remotely in Alaska. Three years later, Glenn and Silvia welcomed their second child, Wolf Song, also born in Fairbanks, however, this time they moved back to wilderness almost immediately after the birth. However, the couple divorced in 2013, after which Silvia and the children went to live in Fairbanks.
