The two Earhart sisters were raised primarily by their <a href=# rel=noopener>grandparents</a>, as their mother and father relocated to Iowa when her father was transferred to the area for work.&nbsp;</p><p>Her maternal grandparents were wealthy, as her grandfather was the president of the <a href=# rel=noopener>Atchison Savings Bank</a>, and Earhart’s life in Kansas was one of comfort and ease.</p><p>Whilst now renowned for its association with Earhart, Atchison was formerly just a regular city along the Missouri river, that was experiencing <a href=# rel=noopener>industrialization</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>Earhart grew up with her distinctive <a href=# rel=noopener>independent spirit</a> and loved being outdoors playing sports, exploring nature and playing make believe with her sister. Earhart reportedly <a href=# rel=noopener>said of her childhood play</a>, “unfortunately I lived at a time when girls were still girls. Though reading was considered proper, many of my outdoor exercises were not.”</p><figure class="wp-block-embed-instagram wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram"></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Move to Iowa</h2><p>Amelia was in the seventh grade when she moved to Iowa to reunite with her parents and saw an aircraft for the first time, although she was largely <a href=# rel=noopener>uninterested</a> by the sight.</p><p>Whilst the Earhart family had been reunited, her father’s <a href=# rel=noopener>alcohol abuse</a> caused him to lose his job in 1915 and enter a period of rehab, which put the family under financial strain and ushered in an unhappy <a href=# rel=noopener>period</a> in Earhart’s childhood.</p><p>Though out of <a href=# rel=noopener>employment</a> for a while, Edvin found a job in St. Paul, Minnesota, which prompted the family’s next relocation.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Changing Schools</h2><p>Though homeschooled in Atchison, Earhart had enrolled in school in Iowa and was a pupil at <a href=# rel=noopener>Central High school</a> in St. Paul. She wouldn’t remain a student there for long however, as Amelia’s mother took her daughters to <a href=# rel=noopener>Chicago, Illinois</a>, when Edvin lost his job once again.</p><p>Earhart eventually graduated from <a href=# rel=noopener>Hyde Park School</a> in Chicago in 1915. Of her family’s frequent moves Earhart <a href=# rel=noopener>said</a>, “I have never lived more than four years in any one place and always have to ask ‘Which one?’ when a stranger greets me by saying, ‘I’m from your hometown’.”</p><figure class="wp-block-embed-instagram wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram"></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Legacy</h2><p>Amelia Earhart’s life and legacy has been celebrated in numerous ways, not least in her hometown. In Atchison, The <a href=# rel=noopener>Amelia Earhart Birthplace Museum</a> welcomes visitors hoping to learn more about the aviator’s early life and career, whilst the county has an airport named for the adventurer – the <a href=# rel=noopener>Amelia Earhart Memorial Airport</a>.</p><p>The <a href=# rel=noopener>Amelia Earhart Hangar Museum</a> provides a further space to honor Earhart, whilst multiple artworks have been installed in and around the city to remember her, such as the <a href=# rel=noopener>Amelia Earhart Earthworks</a>.</p><p>Pride for Amelia extends beyond her native Atchison however, and her achievements and advocacy for women’s rights. Amelia was committed to leading the life she wanted, rather than conforming to conventional female roles at the time.</p><p>Earhart’s niece told <a href=# rel=noopener>Teen Vogue</a>, “Amelia was a great flier and adventurer, and she was also a great advocate for women’s rights, education for girls and women, and careers for women”.</p><p>Her fateful final voyage in 1937, and the <a href=# rel=noopener>mystery</a> surrounding what happened to her, has inspired multiple theories and researchers remain determined to reveal the circumstances of Earhart’s disappearance.</p><p>Learn more about Earhart’s life in the YouTube video below.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed-youtube wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p></p></figure><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo63NrK6eqqNjsLC5jrCfnqqVYrGqsIyapJ6kmZZ6pq3RoZirrF2cv7DDjK6naA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
