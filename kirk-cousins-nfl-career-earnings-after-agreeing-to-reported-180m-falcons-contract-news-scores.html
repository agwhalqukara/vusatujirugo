Two seasons later, he agreed to a two-year extension with the organization totaling $66 million. He also earned another $30 million during his final season with Minnesota in 2023, per Spotrac.</p><p>Atlanta is taking a risk by signing Cousins, as he's coming off a season-ending torn Achilles that he suffered in Week 8. He'll also be 36 years old at the beginning of the 2024 regular season.</p><p>Still, he threw for 2,331 yards and 18 touchdowns compared to just five interceptions in eight starts prior to the injury. If Cousins bounces back strong, he should help the Falcons as they look to return to the playoffs for the first time since 2017.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmianJqupLTEq6meqJ%2BnwW%2BvzqZmmqqknrCtsdJoaGlpYWeDcX2MpKCro12YvLa%2FyKeqZqaWoXqkrdGenKtllZa%2Fr7XNoKpmmZapsrN5wKCpnp2Zo7RuwM5mqZ6on6fBprCMam9ppV2brq2vzqeqZpufo8GzrcKt</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>.
