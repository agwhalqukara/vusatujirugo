Oh, but anyone who thinks that would be very wrong, my friends. You have to remember that in those days, teams simply did not pass the ball a lot so Luckman's accomplishments cannot be measured by just statistics."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

Tied for most TD passes in a game (7); three-time league leader in TD passes;&nbsp;averaged 8.4&nbsp;yards per attempt, second best all-time; 1943 performance of&nbsp;13.9 percent touchdown rate (best ever in a single-season), and&nbsp;his 10.9&nbsp;yards per attempt is second all-time; first ever 400-yard passing performance and 28 TDs in a season was a record that lasted for many years.</p><p>Yes, his overall numbers, particularly his TD to interception rate, may not be impressive. But in addition to the records I described above, he was the QB in the 73-0 1940 title game and was the 1943 MVP.</p><p>Luckman led the NFL in yards per attempt an NFL record seven times, including a record five consecutive years from 1939&nbsp;to&nbsp;1943.</p><p>A winner? Well, he led the "Monsters of the Midway" to championships in 1940, 1941, 1943, and 1946.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmianJqupLTEq6meqJ%2BnwW%2BvzqZmmqqknrCtsdJobm1rZWmCbq%2FHopqan59ir6at0axkraCVYn92ecarnJqslajBbq7EmqmsZaChrrqx0axkoqZdm7%2BiusKhoKydXZ22tMDOq7A%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
